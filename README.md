# Knot - Deploy repo of kubernetes spec files to a cluster

Each time a kubernetes cluster is created, there is probably a set of yaml files that need to be deployed.  Use Knot to
read from a repo (github) and deploy all the desired yaml.  Knot was originally intended for use while deploying kubernetes
clusters using VMware Enterprise PKS.  However, it works with any kubernetes cluster.

## ENV Variables to set
* KNOT_TYPE - Where to get the files.
    * Supported values: [github]
* KNOT_URI - Path to get the values
    * I.E. - owner/garreeoke/repository/k8_setup/branch/master
* KNOT_AUTH - How to authenticate
    * local - Will try to read kubeconfig in users home directory
    * cluster - Use this when running as a job on K8s cluster
* GITHUB_USER - Specify github user if repo is not public
* GITHUB_TOKEN - Specify github access token for user if repo is not public

## Kubernetes
Look in the k8s directory for examples of configuring a job to run.  Examples below is the yaml files in the k8s folder.

* With config map
    * \# kubectl create -f knot_configMap.yaml
    * \# kubectl create -f knot_job_with_configMap.yaml
* Without configMap
    * \# kubectl create -f knot_job_with_env.yaml
    
After the job runs, the pod will still be available to look at the logs.  Once you are done looking at the logs,
delete the job.
    
## VMware PKS Enterprise
To use with PKS Enterprise, copy the contents of k8s/knot_pks.yaml to the desired plan in OpsMgr.
There is a box underneath "(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution" in Plan configuration, paste contents of desired yaml there.
Be sure to modify the knot_pks.yaml (KNOT_URI environment variable) to point to the correct github repo.

## Docker Example

* docker run -e "KNOT_AUTH=local" -e "KNOT_TYPE=github" -e "KNOT_URI=owner/garreeoke/repository/k8_setup/branch/master" -v /Users/torgersona/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config garreeoke/knot

## Notes
* Only single entity yaml files are supported right now.  For example, if you have something to deploy that is a
service and a deployment.  A K8s yaml file for each one should be used.
* The repo can have one level of sub-directories.  This is useful if you want to place all related yamls for
individual services in their own place.

## Working On
* Multiple repos
